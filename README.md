# Types-of-Mobile-Apps

This project aims to analyse two datasets of mobile app derived from [an iOS dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) and [an Android dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps) with a goal to provide`the app development team`with a report on`what type of apps that are likely to attract more users`on Google Play and App Store for them to build`an app in English that are free to download and install`.


Note that this project provides me with opportunities for practising the basic skills such as
1. Write functions and use the functions with positional arguments and keyword arguments.
2. Use for loop and nested for loop with lists.
3. Use the sorted(iterable_object, key, reverse=False) function to sort the order in a list.    
4. Use dictionary to make frequency tables.
